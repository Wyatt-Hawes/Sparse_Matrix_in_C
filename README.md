==============

Sparse
---------
> usage "Sparse <input> <output>", creates a sparse matrix with the inputted matrices and does some arithmatic on them
> There must be the format as the first line being "x y z" where x is the number of entries for the first matrix, y being
> the number of entries for the second matrix and Z being the size of the matrices
> The next set of lines must be in the form "i j val"

Matrix
---------
> A sparse matrix ADT that supports some arithmatic. Any entries where the value is 0 is not stored so the matrix works much
> better with large matrices.
